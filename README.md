This MATLAB Code will create a diagram to determine the overall changes in temperature based on anomalies. 
The dataset used for this is located [Here](https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/ftp/trends/temp/jonescru/global.txt)
 
This is also work on reproducing figure 5 from the paper [CVXR: An R package for Disciplined Convex Optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/cvxr_paper.pdf).

This is intended to be used for the NAU class EE599 - Machine Learning class as part of the second coding project to demonstrate reprousable research.

The initial report for this assignmnet can be found [Here](https://github.com/Dahlmannnnn/Coding_Project_2/blob/master/Coding%20Project%202%20wk2%20Alexander%20Dahlmann.pdf).

This file can be run by activating MATLAB and running the .m file in the repository, or by running the makefile.
